Use language primitives over functions: like `for (const object of array)` over `array.forEach()`.
Avoid `let` and never use `var`.
Keep code simple and ideally reusable, but do not make everything a reusable function.
Always use `.map()` over creating a new array and manually pushing elements one for one.
When making a PR, make a branch describing the feature in a few words like `simple-feature-name` then make a single commit called `\`folder1/folder/file.md\`: edit file` or  `\`folder1/folder/*\`: edit files` then run `gh pr create --fill`.
Run `npm run format` after changes.
